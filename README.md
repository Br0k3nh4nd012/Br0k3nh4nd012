<p>I'm Gokulakrishnan, a passionate software engineer with a knack for diving deep into new technologies. I love solving real-world problems, one line of code at a time, and my journey is all about breaking things (and fixing them better) through collaboration, open source, and continuous learning. Let's create cool tech together!<br><br>
When I’m not coding, I’m probably debugging some obscure error, building new projects, or contributing to open source – because that’s where the magic happens! 💥</p>

##### 🧑‍💻 My Stack: Simplicity Meets Power

But I'm always up for new challenges and ready to dive into the unknown! The world of tech keeps evolving, and I’m exploring new tools and frameworks to keep building cool, efficient solutions. 🌱


## 💎 Cool Thing I Made: **Ruby Ipify Gem**

I'm super proud of the little Ruby gem I wrote called [**ruby_ipify**](https://github.com/Br0k3nh4nd012/ruby_ipify)! It fetches your public IP, just like that, from the ipify API. Simple, but super handy for devs. Sometimes the best things in life are simple and small! 💡


## 🌟 Fun projects played with 

- **[CodeCurious](https://github.com/Br0k3nh4nd012/codecurious-rails-turbo-tailwind)**  
  Rails + Turbo + Tailwind = Perfection 🔥! Check it out to see how these bad boys work together.

- **[Sample OLX (Rails)](https://github.com/Br0k3nh4nd012/sampleOLX--ROR)**  
  OLX Clone in Rails because **who doesn't love classifieds?** 🧑‍💻📲

- **[Inventory Management Client](https://github.com/Br0k3nh4nd012/Inventory-Management-Client)**  
  Keeping track of your inventory, the React way! ⚙️

## 🤝 Open-Source Stuff I’ve Contributed To

- **[Terrastories](https://github.com/Br0k3nh4nd012/terrastories)**  
  A platform where **geospatial data** meets community storytelling. 🌍📖
  
- **[CASA](https://github.com/Br0k3nh4nd012/casa)**  
  Customizable community engagement with features that are cool and useful—because open-source is all about sharing awesome ideas! 🚀


So, let’s **build stuff**! Whether it’s fixing that strange bug you’re fighting with or contributing to the next big open-source project, hit me up! 💻🚀 Let’s change the world, one pull request at a time.
